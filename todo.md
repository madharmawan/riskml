Here is the list of things that needs to be done in order to complete the project. Will be continuously updated based on status
Create a pull request to change maybe how we think about the implementation of it.

# Game Creation, Logic
- Make unit tests:
    - Cards.py
    - Game.py
    - Territory.py
    - Continent.py
    - Map.py, 
    - Player.py
- Make acceptance tests:
    - Create a generalized map of n continents with (m_1, ..., m_n) territories in each.
    - Play a simple game and try to break it but still follow the rules.
- Cards.py
    - Create a set of cards that are random (but there are a set amount of CARDS in a game, with a certain number of STANDARD and WILDCARDs)
    - Shuffle function that is random
    - Dealing it to a PLAYER's hand
    - A class variable on how many sets have been turned in 
    - A generator function that returns how many troops give to a PLAYER
    - A Standard Class that creates STANDARD Cards
    - A Wildcard Class that creates WILDCARD Cards
- Game.py
    - <INSERT TASKS>
