    """
    A PLAYER instance acts on the TERRITORYs on the MAP. The main way they act on it is
    by attacking, moving, placing. In addition, there are getter methods that are helpful
    in receiving statistics of the board, i.e., getting information about how many troops are
    at a specific territory, how many TERRITORYs a player owns, etc. In addition, PLAYERs
    interact with the CARDSET class to handle turning in and receiving troop bonuses from them.
