Because of the fact that this is our first experience with using GitHub and working on a large nonacademic project, this markdown file is used to facilitate how to make
a pull request.

# What is a Pull Request?

A pull request – also referred to as a merge request – is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process 
of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

The idea of a pull request is that it acts as a buffer to stop accidentally breaking the whole system. In a repo that contains all the project's code, metadata, etc.
A maintainer (Matthew Dharmawan) is responsible for maintianing the repository. This means the maintainer is in charge of which updates can be merged with the final 
project and made available for the other users (Oscar Tapia and Joseph Selfani). 

To make a pull request, the repo maintainer reviews new code updates from a developer (Matthew, Oscar, Joseph) and determines if it is ready to be released. Pull requests
encourage collaboration and open communication when working on new product updates. They also keep teams motivated by notifying the team when someone completes a new feature.

# How to Make a Pull Request?

# 1. Fork the Repository
It should be on the top right corner of screen

# 2. Make, edit, alter, delete files
In other words, work on the project

# 3. Commit your files and Create PR
Click the contribute button on the main page of the forked repository. Create a pull request. Do not do anything after that

# 4. Maintainer will Review it
The repo maintainer will see that you made a PR and approve or not approve of it. After it has been approved. Delete the fork, so you do not accidentally work on it.

# 5. How to Delete Fork
On the origin repository, click pull requests tab on the top, and then clicked the closed button (next to open). Then select your fork and delete it. This is so that you do not work on a forked version that is not up to date with the project.


# Everytime you want to make a change you have to submit a pull request and fork the repository.


# Try it Out to Test
Make a pull request that creates a new python folder with any function inside. Call it pullreqtest.py
Or, make an edit to pullreqtest.py by deleting code, adding more, or editing the existing code.
